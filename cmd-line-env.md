## Q1) (Alias) Neat listing of files :)

Create an alias that extends ls (list) functionality with the following:

* Display the size of each item
* Sorts it by size 
* Human readable, 1 column format

Name this alias as `lread`.

## Q2) (Processes)

* Create a bash file called `process.sh`. Inside it, print "I am tired", then sleep 2h, then print "I am fresh!"
* Run this process, then send it to the background.
* Return into foreground, then kill it.
